# Chainguard Image Pricing Policy
#
# This file defines pricing tiers and volume discounts for Chainguard images.
# Each tier can have multiple volume ranges with different per-image list prices.
# The discounted price is automatically calculated by applying discount_percent to list_price.
#
# Format:
#   tier_name:
#     - min: <minimum quantity inclusive>
#       max: <maximum quantity inclusive, or null for unlimited>
#       list_price: <list price per image before discount>
#       discount_percent: <discount percentage as float (e.g., 0, 10, 20.5)>
